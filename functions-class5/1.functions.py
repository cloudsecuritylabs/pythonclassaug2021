'''
for code to be efficient and easily understandable,
it must include functions.
--> Functions help programmers avoid reusing code,
--> Functions can be shared among developers
--> Functions are used to define a block of code that can be reused over and over.
--> Functions are also known as methods, procedures, modules, subroutines and processes
--> is better to write functions that only perform one specific task.

When we write larger programs we want to keep our code organized
'''
import datetime
## create a function
## demo the docstring in a function
# help a function



# write a function that gets two strings (name, email)
## call function with parameter and without parameters

# Keyword arguments

    hello()
    print(f'num1 = {num1}')
    print(f'num2 = {num2}')

    print("Hello there")

# print(my_sum())


# print(my_sum(4,5))
